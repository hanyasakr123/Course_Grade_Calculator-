# Course_Grade_Calculator-

Welcome to my course grade calculator! 

This tool aims to help student calculate their overall course grade based on the percent weightings and grades for the course's assignments, quizzes, midterm exam, final exam and labs. 

Javascript was used to operate the backend calculations, while HTML and CSS were used for user interface. 

The references that helped me complete this project included the following youtube links:
